# react-animation-group

A crappy fork of the [React TransitionGroup](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group) repo
for creating a POC component that automatically animates the changes that happen to its children.

# This library is not production ready and its author highly discourages its usage

# Ok, but what is this about?

See [this example](https://jsfiddle.net/josepot/c4vx8w26/1/).

# State of this project

Whenever I get some time I will improve the API so that it's possible to configure
the animations.

I'm also planning to cleanup/organize the code and to add some tests.

In the meanwhile this is just a basic POC.
